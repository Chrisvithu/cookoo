<p>We believe that unique travel experiences make great stories. And this world deserves as much positive stories as it can possibly get. That’s why we started Cookoo.We connect travellers and locals in cities all over the world – directly and on-demand. Together they exchange culture and create unique and personal travel experiences - experiences worth sharing.

Whenever you are in need of trustworthy personal guidance abroad, we make sure there is a local available to let you experience the city like a local. 100% private and at a fair price.

So go ahead, meet new people and embrace new cultures the way you want it, whenever you want it and share your story. Because sharing positive stories will brighten up the world!</p>
